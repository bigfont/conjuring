    <h2>History</h2>

    <p>The Salt Spring Conjuring Club first met on Wednesday 02 October, 2013. Since then we have had over 122 visits by 30 attendees, including seven regulars, who now form the clubs core. This cadre of budding magicians range in age from seven to fourteen.</p>

    <p>
        We currently meet every Friday from 3:30 to 5 pm (excluding statutory holidays) at the Salt Spring Island Public Library. On the first Friday of every month, we put on a free public show in the program room. To date, we have had two public performances and we are planning more.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Conjuring Club is free public service. It builds confidence, friendships, and skills for children and youth. It promotes the arts. It develops connections and community.
    </p>

    <h2>Future</h2>

    <p>
        <strong>We are planning a major public performance for Friday 05 December, 2014.</strong> Our existing public performances are in fact public dress rehearsals in preparation for the gala show. To increase the production value, we are building a stage with curtains, procuring costumes, developing a script, and encouraging commitment from our regulars.
